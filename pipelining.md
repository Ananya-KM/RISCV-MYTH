# Pipelining

### **Pipeline Logic and Hardware Computation (Pythagoras Theorem Example)**

---

### **1. Computation Goal: Pythagoras Theorem**

We want to find the distance `c` using this formula:

\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

To do this using hardware, we need to:
- Square values `a` and `b`
- Add the squared results
- Take the square root of the result

Modern processors (like one running at 1 GHz) can only do a limited amount of work (around 20 logic gates deep) in one clock cycle.  
If the work takes more time than a cycle allows, the output wonâ€™t be correct.

---

### **2. Pipeline Concept: Distributing Logic Across Clock Cycles**

This calculation is too complex to finish in just one clock cycle.  
So, we **split the work into steps**, done over **multiple clock cycles**.

---

---

### **3. RTL Approach (Register Transfer Level)**

In RTL design:
- You write code for the logic (squaring, adding, square root)
- You manually add flip-flops to hold values between stages

#### Example:

- **Cycle 1:** Compute `a^2` and `b^2`, store them
- **Cycle 2:** Add them â†’ `a^2 + b^2`, store the sum
- **Cycle 3:** Take the square root â†’ get final `c`, store it

RTL works, but you need to **manually manage** all the timing.  
This makes RTL harder and more complex when your design gets bigger.

---

### **4. TL-Verilog: Pipeline Abstraction and Simplification**

TL-Verilog gives you a **simpler way** to build pipelines.

- You define a **pipeline block**, like `|calc`.
- You split your logic into **stages**, like `@1`, `@2`, `@3`.
- TL-Verilog **automatically adds flip-flops** between stages.

You only focus on **what operation** happens in each stage.  
You donâ€™t need to worry about how data is stored and moved â€” TL-Verilog handles that.

---

### **5. Example: Code and Logic Comparison**

TL-Verilog code looks like the pipeline diagram.  
You describe each stage and the operation in it.

You just write:
- `@1` â†’ square values
- `@2` â†’ add them
- `@3` â†’ take square root

Behind the scenes, **TL-Verilog automatically adds flip-flops** and handles all timing.

---

### **Traditional RTL Code:**

In RTL (Register Transfer Level) design:
- You have to **clearly write out** when each operation (square, add, square root) should happen.
- You also need to **manually add flip-flops** between each step to store intermediate results.

This means:
- More lines of code
- More chances for mistakes
- You must handle **timing** carefully to make sure everything works in the right order

---

### **TL-Verilog Code:**

In TL-Verilog:
- You define each **stage** (like Stage 1, Stage 2â€¦) in a clear way.
- You **donâ€™t need to write flip-flops** â€” TL-Verilog adds them for you automatically based on how you write the stages.

This gives many advantages:
- **Less code** to write
- Code is **easier to read**
- Fewer bugs, since timing and data storage are handled for you
- Faster design and development process

### Timing Abstraction and Flexibility in TL-Verilog:
Absolutely! Here's your detailed content rewritten in a **simplified and clear form** â€” same meaning, just easier to understand, and structured to follow smoothly:

---

### **6. TL-Verilogâ€™s Main Benefit: Timing Abstraction**

The **big advantage** of TL-Verilog is that it **separates function from timing**.

- **Function** = What the circuit does (like squaring, adding, square rooting)
- **Timing** = When these actions happen (which stage, in which clock cycle)

With TL-Verilog:
- You can **change the number of pipeline stages** without touching the core logic.
- The logic stays exactly the same â€” only the timing (when things happen) changes.

---

### **Traditional RTL vs. TL-Verilog**

In **traditional RTL**:
- If you change how many cycles something takes, you need to **manually adjust flip-flops and logic**.
- This is **time-consuming** and **can introduce bugs**.

In **TL-Verilog**:
- You can **move operations to different stages** or **add more stages**, and the design still works the same.
- It gives you **flexibility and safety** during timing changes.

---

### **7. Why Change Pipeline Staging?**

Imagine this:

- A signal (`a`) starts from one **corner of the chip**.
- The final result (`c`) is needed on the **opposite corner**.
- On modern silicon, this might take **25 clock cycles** for the signal to travel across!

#### ðŸ”§ What do you do?

You **stretch** the pipeline â€” add more stages to give time for signals to move across the chip.

Example:
- Originally: 3 stages (square, add, square root)
- Now: 5 stages, with some extra stages just for signal travel time

ðŸ’¡ **Important:** Youâ€™re still doing the same operations â€” only the **timing is adjusted**.

---

### **8. Circuit Behavior is Still Guaranteed**

With TL-Verilog:
- Even if you change when something happens, the **behavior stays correct**.
- You just need to make sure the output is used **after** itâ€™s ready.

âœ… This makes TL-Verilog **much safer** than RTL when modifying timing.

---

### **9. Traditional RTL Has These Challenges:**

If you want to change timing (like add pipeline stages), you must:
- Rewire all the flip-flops manually
- Change logic to match new timing
- Carefully test the design to make sure it still works

This is:
- **Hard**
- **Time-consuming**
- **Prone to bugs**

---

### **TL-Verilog Makes It Easier**

- You just **adjust the stage** â€” no rewiring needed
- Code stays clean
- Less room for mistakes
- Much faster to develop and test

---

### âœ… **Key Takeaways**

- **Pipelining** splits complex logic into smaller steps over multiple clock cycles.
- **TL-Verilog** makes pipeline design **simple and safe**.
- **Flexibility:** You can change the number of stages without changing your logic.
- **Timing abstraction** means your design works even if you move operations to different cycles â€” perfect for handling real hardware delays like long signal travel.
